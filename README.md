# Techdegree_project-5: Public API Requests

 Use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

 In this project:
 *  Request a `JSON` object from the `API` and parse the data
 *  12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location
 *  Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information
